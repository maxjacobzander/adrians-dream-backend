# Adrian's Dream Website —— Backend

This is going to be an interactive backend for the Adrian's Dream website (https://www.adriansdream.com). Built with Rails.

## Outline
This will be a Rails App with an MVC structure. Owners will be able to login to the site (authentication with Devise) and either view events or fill out a form to add new events. This will persist to a database that the frontend can fetch from.

## Planned Updates
My goal is to get it up and functional. Once it is, I will set up the fetch from the frontend and will clean up the backend UI.
